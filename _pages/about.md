Hi! My name is Jolie [ˈʤɑˌli]. I'm a Computer Science & Linguistics undergraduate student at University of Washington (UW).

I am fortunate to have been advised by [Prof. Annie T. Chen](https://annietchen.github.io/) and to have collaborated on the [Svoboda Diaries Project](https://www.svobodadiariesproject.org/).

My research interests include model interpretability, multilingual settings, and interdisciplinary applications (e.g., in digital humanities). 

I am also passionate about computing education and have been a teaching assistant for many quarters.
